## 💡 About Me

I'm a curious and solutions-driven IT professional with a **B.Sc. in Software Engineering** and over a year of experience in **IT support**, **cloud infrastructure**, and **full-stack web development**.

From configuring secure networks to deploying scalable cloud systems, I love making tech work better — smarter, faster, and safer. Think of me as a full-time debugger — always learning, always improving! 👩‍💻🔧
